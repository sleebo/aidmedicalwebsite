        abstract: "Aims and method: To examine the association between the use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and time to care home placement. We compared patients who were prescribed ChEIs in 2006 with those who were not with respect to their placement in care homes over a 4-year period, using survival analysis. Results: During the first 30 months of follow-up there was a delay in care home placement by a median of 12 months in those who took ChEIs compared with those who did not. However, at the end of the follow-up there was no significant reduction in the probability of being in a care home setting between those who had taken ChEIs compared with those who had not (hazard ratio 0.75,95% CI 0.25-6, P = 0.1)",
        clinicalImplications: "The study provides some evidence to suggest that prescribing ChEIs may be associated with a delay in the timing of care home placement as observed in the first 2.5 years of treatment. However, based on purely observational data, no conclusion can be made as to whether such association is causal",

        abstract: "Background. A statistically significant association between season of birth and suicidal behaviour has been reported. However, the effect of month of birth on the choice of suicide method is yet to be established. Aim. This study examines the association between commonly used methods of suicide and season of birth using data on suicide collected over a 21-year period in England, Wales and Scotland. The sample size available, in excess of 52,000 suicides, greatly exceeds all previous studies in this field. Method. Data on suicides registered between 1979 and 2000 were obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for England and Wales, and the General Register Office (GRO) for Scotland. Our analyses include all suicides [ICD 9 codes; E950 E959] and undetermined injury deaths [E980E989], reported between 1979 and 2000 in England, Wales and Scotland for persons born between 1941 and 1966. We used Poisson and negative binomial generalised linear models (GLMs) with seasonal harmonic components. Results. Adjusting for the year of birth, the model predicts that the average increase in risk of suicide between the trough (October) and the peak (May) of the seasonal component is 17.9% (95% CI 1333%). For males the estimated increase in risk was 15% (95% CI 522%) and for females 27% (95% CI 847%). The effect of month of birth on suicide applied to all commonly used methods, with the exception of suicide by burning (SBB) with a significant increase of 16% (95% CI 237%) in people born in January compared to other methods. Conclusion. Our results replicate our earlier finding of an association between season of birth and suicide incidence. Birth rates of persons who kill themselves show a disproportionate excess in spring compared to other months. The unexpected observed finding in suicide by burning (SBB) may represent the effect of latitude and warrants further examination. Seasonality of birth in suicide may enhance our understanding of some biological aspects in its aetiology and give directions for future research. 2010 Informa UK Ltd.",

        abstract: "Background: A reduction in suicide in England and Wales has been reported after the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA. It may be plausible therefore to expect a much greater impact on suicide in the UK in response to the events of 7 July 2005, caused by the first suicide terrorist attack by Islamic extremists on British soil. Aims: To examine the effect of the 7 July 2005 terrorist attacks in London on suicide rates in England and Wales. Method: Analysis of number of suicide (ICD-10 codes X60-X84) and undetermined injury deaths (ICD-10 codes Y10-Y34) reported in England and Wales in the 12 weeks before and after 7 July 2005. We used Shewhart Control Charts based on Poisson rates to explore adjusted daily and weekly suicide rates and rate differences with respect to 7 July 2005. Results: A brief but significant reduction in daily suicide rate was observed a few days after the terrorist attack in London on 7 July 2005. Further reduction was also observed on the 21 July 2005, coinciding with the second wave of attacks. No similar reduction in suicide was seen during the same period in the previous 4 years. Poisson regression models with indicator variables for each day in July 2005 revealed a reduction of 40% of the expected daily rate for these 2 days only. We found no evidence of any longer-term effect on suicide. Conclusions: The study findings are contrary to our expectation and only weakly support Durkheim's theory that periods of national threat lower the suicide rate through the impact on social cohesion. It is possible that previous experience of IRA terrorism in the UK may have limited the effect of the 7 July 2005 attacks on suicide in England and Wales. The shock value of suicide terrorism and its psychological potency appear to diminish over time as the tactic becomes overused.

        abstract: "Reply to commentaries by Piet Jongbloet (see record 2008-05194-027) and Jayanti Chotai (see record 2008-05194-019) on the current authors' original article Effect of month of birth on the risk of suicide (see record 2006-06728-005). Jongbloet provides an alternative explanation of our findings about the effect of month of birth on suicide that is based on the oocyte origins hypothesis as opposed to the maternal-foetal origin hypothesis. The oocyte hypothesis (also referred to in literature as 'conception hypothesis') may have significant implications in psychiatry. The intricate interplay between non-optimal oocyte maturation and genes results in a complex pathogenesis of the resultant foetuses or individuals. We are not clear as to how this hypothesis actually differs from the maternal-foetal origin hypothesis used to explain our findings. In response to Chotai, we did not look at hanging in relation to month of birth in our study. We examined the relationship between month of birth and violent suicide (including hanging) as opposed to nonviolent suicide, but found no significant association. Studies with sufficient power to detect the association between month of birth and risk of hanging are required to show whether one truly exists. Seasonality of birth studies in relation to suicide may enhance our understanding of some biological aspects in the aetiology of suicide such as the oocyte origins hypothesis proposed by Jongbloet.

        abstract: "Background: Primary care is probably the most suitable setting to start a strategy for suicide prevention for the elderly especially as more people are seen before committing suicide in primary care than in secondary care. Aim: This study examines the nature of complaints and timing of presentation to general practitioners by suicide victims in their last GP consultation, comparing persons aged 65 and over with those aged between 18 and 64. Methods: Details of all cases of suicide verdict and open verdict, which were returned in inquests, held at the Coroner's Court of Birmingham and Solihull, between January 1995 and December 1999 were reviewed. The study provided a comparison between older people (65+) and younger adults. Results: Older people had more physical illness, and were more likely to have seen their GP in the 6 months before suicide. Younger adults presented with more psychiatric symptoms, while older adults presented with more physical symptoms. Complaints to the GP in the last consultation were significantly different between the two age groups. Older people are more commonly present with physical pain and depression. Conclusions: The study found that elderly suicide victims had different characteristics and attributes from those of younger adults presenting to primary care. This difference may have implications for suicide research, training of primary care staff and suicide prevention programmes. Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        abstract: "Background: Month of birth as a suicide risk factor has not been adequately explored. The findings of published studies are contradictory and inconclusive. Aims: To examine the association between suicide and month of birth using suicide data for a 22-year period in England and Wales. The sample size of 26 915 suicides greatly exceeds all previous studies. Method: We analysed all suicides (ICD-9 codes E950-959) and deaths from undetermined injury (E980-989) reported between 1979 and 2001 in England and Wales for persons born between 1955 and 1966, using Poisson and negative binomial generalised linear models with seasonal components. Results: Birth rates of people who later kill themselves show disproportionate excess for April, May and June compared with the other months. Overall, we found an increase of 17% in the risk of suicide for people born in the peak month (spring-early summer) compared with those born in the trough month (autumn-early winter); this risk increase was larger for women (29.6%) than for men (13.7%). Conclusions: The 'month of birth' factor in suicide can be interpreted in terms of the foetal origins hypothesis. Our findings might have implications for our understanding of the multifaceted aetiology of suicide and may eventually offer new strategies for research and prevention.

        abstract: "Medical conditions of world leaders are often regarded as state secrets and seem to be made public only after the person has left office or after their demise. History is littered with examples of occasions when a leader's illness was not made public-for no apparent reason except to guarantee or to prolong period in office. Brain changes can lead to depression, changes in decision making ability, changes in mental capacity, reduced energy and reduced motivation. These may make political leaders indecisive and perhaps inclined to adopt the status quo. Richard Nixon was suspected to have become temporarily emotionally impaired during the Watergate scandal. His reported emotional turmoil strongly suggested he may have been at high risk of suicide or developing psychosis. Alcohol has also been a problem for two of the most well known world leaders. Mental and physical health of world leaders and their impact on history cannot be predicted and as history has the habit of repeating itself and there will always be a world leader whose mental health problem may influence the world and course of history. However, it must be noted that we owe a great deal to world leaders who shaped our destiny while suffering from Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, depression, alcohol dependence, bipolar affective disorder and even neurosyphilis.

        abstract: "Background. Incidence of drowning varies among countries and even communities within the same country. The manner of death may remain undetermined even when the diagnosis of drowning is confirmed or excluded. It is expected that drowning suicide rates in some of the available studies may have been over- or under-reported because of misclassification. Objectives. This study presents data on the time trends, age/sex mortality rates from death by drowning in England and Wales between 1979 and 2001. All coroners' verdicts in death by drowning; suicide, deaths undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted were examined. Methods. Counts of suicide due to drowning and submersion (ICD 9 codes; E954) and undetermined injury deaths (E984), reported in England and Wales between 1979 and 2001 were obtained from National Statistics (ONS). National population estimates were used to calculate age-specific rates and age-standardised rates of death by drowning. Results. Over the last 23 years, there has been a gradual and significant reduction in drowning deaths. The decline in drowning suicide was less evident in the elderly, particularly those over the age of 75. During the study period, 62 and 38% of all death by drowning attracted an open verdict and suicide, respectively. Elderly drownings appear to attract more verdicts of suicide compared to younger age groups (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 2.3-8.3). Women, particularly elderly, are more likely to have a suicide verdict returned in drowning compared to men (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-1.6). Conclusion. The high rate of open verdicts in death by drowning over the study period and compared to any other method of fatal self harm in England and Wales confirms the difficulties in reaching a firm conclusion in drowning death. Combining suicide and all undetermined deaths in drowning in nationally collected statistics may result in grossly exaggerated rates and misleading trends in suicidal drowning.

This study used coroner's inquest records of 200 elderly in Cheshire who killed themselves, and in which their unexpected deaths attracted a verdict of suicide. Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical aspects of the suicidal process and health care contact before death are reviewed. Unlike most available studies, cases of unexpected death in which an open verdict was given were not included in this study, which covered a 13 year period. The findings are interpreted and compared to the currently available literature on suicide in the elderly. Late life suicide is characterised by less warning, higher lethality and greater prevalence of depression and physical illness. However, suicide risk often remains undetected. All suicidal behaviour in the elderly should be taken seriously by psychiatric and primary care services, in order to reduce suicide rates in the elderly.",

A literature search has not found studies which examined childlessness as a possible risk factor in elderly suicide. In this study we attempt to explore whether childlessness has any significant association with elderly suicide and whether this differs between women and men. Data was extracted from the records of coroners' inquests into all unexpected deaths of persons aged 60 and over, in Cheshire, over a period of 13 years from  1989-2001. The study found no significant gender difference in childlessness in elderly suicide victims (P>.05). Significantly fewer widowed men who committed suicide were childless (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.02-0.3 P<.001). A history of deliberate self-harm (DSH) and being previously known to services were found to be significantly lower in childless female victims compared to elderly mothers (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-0.9 P<.05). Leaving suicide notes and the method of suicide did not appear to be significantly influenced by a childless status in either of the sexes (P>.05). The protective effect of having children appears to diminish in old age. Childless females appear to be at a higher risk of succeeding in their first suicide attempt and more importantly, can easily escape the attention of services.",

Data were collected through anonymous questionnaires posted to hospital nursing and medical staff at Hollins Park Hospital, Warrington, UK, and to all GPs within the hospital catchments area. Forty-five percent of GPs, 33% of psychiatrists, and 76% of nursing staff (p < 0.05) felt strongly that human beings are made up of spirit as well as body. More nurses felt that spiritual care is equally as important as other forms of care (52%) compared with psychiatrists (33%) and GPs (29%). A higher percentage of nursing than medical staff had previous training in this area and were more likely than medical staff to consider themselves appropriate to give spiritual advice. A total of 20% of GPs and 33% of psychiatric staff stated the need for training in this area and GPs especially felt they lacked time. Professionals' views are influenced by cultural and religious backgrounds, with significantly more non-UK born respondents feeling strongly that human beings all have a spiritual component. Many doctors do not consider spiritual care has a role for them to be involved in and many feel too pressured in daily life to take this on. Nurses are more inclined to take a holistic approach to care in this respect. Some people with mental health problems have spiritual care needs and we should be aware of this as an important facet to therapy.",

        abstract: "The aim of this study is to review gender differences in elderly suicide in relation to specific social aspects of the suicidal process and health care contact before death. Such information may have practical value in identifying and targeting vulnerable elderly in whom suicide may be potentially preventable. Data were extracted from the records of coroner's inquests into all reported suicide of persons aged 60 and over, in Cheshire over a period of 13 years 1989-2001. The Coroner's office covers the whole county of Cheshire (population 1 000 000). Men were less likely to have been known to psychiatric services (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.4 95% 0.2-0.6) and with less frequently reported history of previous attempted suicide compared to women (OR 0.5 95% Confidence Intervals [CI] 0.2-1). All deceased from ethnic minorities were men, none of whom had been known to psychiatric services. There was no significant difference between women and men in relation to, physical or psychiatric morbidity, GP contact prior to suicide, intimation of intent or living alone. Of suicide victims not known to services a surprisingly high proportion of 38% and 16% were found to have psychiatric morbidity in men and women respectively. Suicide is an important problem in the elderly with gender playing an important part in their social behaviour but a high proportion of the deceased were not known to local services. Primary Care professionals have an important role to play in reducing elderly suicide as most contact with the health service in elderly suicide seem to be with GPs.",

        abstract: "BACKGROUND: The tragic events of 11 September 2001 and televised scenes of the terrorists' homicidal and suicidal acts could have had an impact on the behaviour of some people, who harbour suicidal ideation or homicidal tendencies.AIMS: To assess the effect of 11 September 2001 on the rate of suicide and homicide in England and Wales.METHOD: Analysis of the number of suicides (ICD-9 codes: E950-E959), undetermined injury deaths (E980-E989) and homicides (E960-E969) in England and Wales in the 12 weeks before and after 11 September 2001 and during a similar period in the previous two years.RESULTS: The number of suicides reported in the month of September 2001 was significantly lower than other months in the same year and any September of the previous 22 years in England and Wales. A suicide reduction in men, regardless of age, occurred in the week starting Tuesday 11 September 2001. A reduction in female suicide occurred during the four weeks following the attack. There was no evidence of a similar effect on homicide.CONCLUSIONS: The tragic events of 11 September 2001 appear to have had a brief but significant inverse effect on suicide.The finding of this study supports Durkheim's theory that periods of external threat create group integration within society and lower the suicide rate through the impact on social cohesion.",

        abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Based on available literature, early psychiatric assessment and vigorous treatment could prevent many suicides in old age. Some studies reported that 80% of the elderly who committed suicide received no psychiatric referral and 15% of elderly suicide victims were under psychiatric care at the time of death. In this study, we attempt to explore the characteristics of elderly suicide victims who were known to psychiatric services compared to those who were not. The findings and possible clinical implications are discussed. METHODS: Data was extracted from the records of coroner's inquests into all unexpected deaths of persons aged 60 and over, in Cheshire over a period of 13 years 1989-2001. The coroner's office covers the whole county of Cheshire (1,000,000 population). Verdicts of accidental death, misadventure and open verdicts were not included in data collection. RESULTS: The study found that male suicide victims were less likely to be known to services [odds ratio (OR) 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.7, P<0.001]. Those who were known to services were less likely to be living alone or leave a note (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6, P<0.001). Significantly fewer widowed older adults who committed suicide were known to psychiatric services (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.7... (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).",

        abstract: "Astrology is no longer regarded as a science by many, because its claims are almost impossible to test empirically in controlled laboratory conditions and it can not meet the scientific need to be reproducible. However, the majority of those who read their 'star signs' can identify aspects of their personality in what they read and it is possible that this may influence their attitudes and actions. The literature has neglected astrological signs as a possible predictor of suicide ideation. To see whether astrological birth signs are associated with suicide and the method used, data was collected from the Public Health Department in North Cheshire representing all the Cheshire Coroner's verdicts of suicide, and open verdicts, in all deceased aged 60 and above between 1989 and 2000. The observed occurrence of deaths due to natural causes, and suicide, in relation to birth signs did not differ significantly from what would be expected from chance. However, the distribution of suicide by hanging appeared significantly higher in those with a birth sign of Virgo and lowest in Sagittarius and Scorpio. The distribution of violent and non-violent suicides in relation to star signs showed higher occurences of violent death in persons born in the summer months.",

In this retrospective review of suicide notes obtained from coroners' records in North Cheshire over a period of 13 years from 1989-2001 we examined the content of suicide notes and their clinical significance. Suicide note-writers may not be typical of the average suicide and information elicited from the study of suicide notes may only apply to note-writers and not to suicide in general. However, the absence of a suicide note must not be considered an indicator of a less serious attempt. Future studies of suicide notes need to provide insight into the unique nature of these documents and to allow better understanding of the suicidal mind.",

The daily numbers of all psychiatric admissions in North Cheshire in a specified year were analysed in relation to meteorological data, which were measured at the meteorological office nearest to the study population. We found a significant inverse relationship (with time lag) between admissions for affective disorders and relative humidity in the week preceding admission. Changes in diurnal variations in temperature, sunshine hours and rainfall a few days before admission were also noted, but the findings did not achieve statistical significance for any diagnostic category. The effect of weather parameters on mental health is likely to be influenced by other seasonal factors, as well as non-climatic factors, predominantly social, that may have contributed to the study findings. Psychiatric admissions reflect the behaviour of patients, carers and medical professionals. The complexity of this behaviour and the day-of-the-week periodicity may have confounded variations associated with the weather. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)",

Out of 125 suicides, 54 (43%) had suicide notes, which were reported in the coroner's records. Of these there were 31 (57%) male and 23 (43%) female Ss (mean age 72 yrs). Elderly suicide note-leavers were more likely to be unknown to psychiatric services and to have used a non-violent method of suicide. Sex, marital status, social isolation, mental or physical morbidity did not appear to be linked with leaving a suicide note. More cases that took an overdose, used plastic bags, electrocuted themselves, or used car exhaust also left suicide notes. Those who died by more violent means such as hanging, drowning, jumping from height, immolation or wounding appeared less likely to have left a suicide note. No statistically significant difference in the content of the suicide notes was observed in relation to sex or age. Many elderly are isolated and may have no one to write a note to, while others have lost the ability to express themselves. Therefore, it is not possible to say that the different incidence of note leaving observed for suicide was due to differing levels of suicidal intent.

The method used was a case-control study, comparing Ss with an International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD--10) diagnosis of schizophrenia who received spiritual healing and those without spiritual healing, in terms of the occurrence of relapses during a specified period. Results indicate that Ss who received spiritual healing relapsed more frequently than those who did not. Relapse was also associated with age and certain methods of healing. The risk of relapse was independent of gender, duration of illness, and type of religion. In conclusion, this study found spiritual healing to be positively associated with relapse of schizophrenia in a sample of elderly Egyptian patients. It is however difficult to ascertain that the relapse actually started after the process of spiritual healing and not before it. The study findings may suggest that religious history, at least in some cases, should be taken into consideration when planning future management.

Two groups of Ss were compared in respect of their baseline CT scan ventricular measurements: those who improved or remained stable cognitively on donepezil (n=43) and those who declined while on donepezil during the study period (n=16). Significant differences in means between the 2 groups were found in relation to the bicaudate span and bicaudate ratio. Of ventricular measurements, only the bicaudate parameters were significantly correlated with the baseline Mini Mental State Examination score as well as the rate of decline in cognitive function during the study period. It is concluded that baseline bicaudate diameter and ratio may be of some value if included in the initial assessment of patients on donepezil. These measurements, in conjunction with other cognitive and functional assessments, may prove helpful in deciding whether to commence treatment, and give a rough guide to the outcome.

The comparison was in respect of epidemiological, social, psychological characteristics, service input and methods of suicide. The elderly, with a history of DSH, were more likely to have been known to the mental health services than the elderly who did not have such a history (P<.05). The two groups used similar methods in their final FSH act. The elderly victims of FSH with or without a previous history of DSH share the same characteristics.

All the subjects were above the age of 60, had history of deliberate self harm before the final act of fatal self harm and attracted either suicide or open verdict returned by the Coroners over a period of four years 1995-1998. We compared the methods of Deliberate Self Harm (DSH) to the methods of Fatal Self Harm (FSH) used by all the included elderly. 18 per cent of elderly victims of FSH had a previous history of DSH and in 35 per cent of the sample, the last known attempt of DSH occurred more than one year prior to the FSH. The majority of the methods that had been used in elderly DSH were used again in their final act of FSH. Nearly two thirds of all the elderly who died of an overdose had attempted suicide earlier by an overdose and one in five of those who died by hanging or drowning used the same method in an unsuccessful attempt of FSH within 12 months. A detailed history of DSH can improve the quality of risk assessment of self harm in the elderly. As more than one in three elderly victims of FSH attempted DSH more than a year prior to the final act, it is important when assessing an elderly DSH attempt that we obtain any previous case notes and question informants about the distant as well as the recent past.",

        abstract: "Patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's are generally cared for at home by a carer, usually a spouse or relative. The authors examined carers' assessment of donepezil on several variables of responses to this treatment. Carer's were asked about their overall opinion, short term memory, long term memory, concentration and memory, mood, emotional reaction, communication, spontaneity, day to day activities, reading, watching TV, sleep, anxiety, interests in old hobbies, meeting others, and driving. Space was also provided for additional comments. Results suggest that asking the carers for their opinion is as valid as carrying out more complicated and time-consuming measurements. Additionally, these results show that carers' views are an important part of the monitoring of patients on donepezil. This data was compared with the preliminary results of M. Evans et al (see record 2000-13773-007). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)",

Verdicts of suicide, misadventure and open verdicts were classified as FSH. Post-mortem brain weight for 142 FSH victims and 150 victims of unexpected, sudden or unexplained death due to natural causes, and from various methods of FSH, were compared.RESULTS: Brain weight of victims of FSH was significantly higher than of those who died of natural causes (P < 0.01); brain weights in both groups were within the normal range for this age group. There was no significant difference in brain weight between different methods of FSH (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The findings require critical examination and further research, to include data from younger age groups. A regional or national suicide neuropathological database could be set up if all victims of FSH underwent routine neurohistochemical post-mortem examination.",

        abstract: "The objective of the study was to assess risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, previously reported in cases control studies from other countries. It was conducted in a psychiatric of unit for the elderly in Warrington, a town in the northwest of England. A retrospective hospital-based, case control method was used comparing 198 cases of Alzheimer's disease (ADRDANINCDS diagnostic criteria) to selected controls (164 other dementias and 176 non-dementing group) in respect of their family, medical and personal histories.The subjects included all patients referred to and seen by the author during a two-year study period. Fifty-eight of 198 Alzheimer's cases reported family history of dementia, compared with 35 of 340 controls (OR=3.27 95% CI 1.89-5.39), p <0.01. The Odds ratio for smoking was 0.68; significant only in men (0.45, p <0.05). The odds ratio for having a history of head injury was 1.52 (0.98-2.35), also significant only in male patientsm (OR=2.1, p <0.05). The study confirms a family history of dementia in first-degree relatives as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. No cases with either Down's syndrome or having family history of it were reported in the study sample. Previously reported headinjury as a risk factor appears to apply to all dementias and was not confined to Alzheimer's disease. The inverse relationship with smoking was evident, but significant only in men.",

In this retrospective review, all applications of sections 5(2) and 5(4) of the Mental Health Act 1983, detaining elderly inpatients in North Cheshire between 1985 and 1997 were reviewed. Forty-three percent of elderly inpatients under s.5(2) regained their voluntary status, while 57% were detained under another section by the end of the 72 hours (p < 0.05). Duration in hospital prior to applying s.5(2), clinical diagnosis of functional mental illness and use of s.5(4) appear to increase the likelihood of converting s.5(2) into other sections. The high rate of non-conversion of s.5(2) in the elderly to s.2 or 3 may imply that in almost half of the cases, emergency detention may have been used to control isolated incidents of disturbed behaviour in otherwise co-operative patients. Educating doctors and nurses in guidance put forward by the Code of Practice (1993) remains, probably, the main key to a better use of emergency holding powers.",

        abstract: "In this 17-year review of death certificates of elderly inpatients of a large psychiatric hospital in North Cheshire, the frequency, trend and value of performing autopsies were examined. Details of death certificates were compared with certificates issued after post-mortem examination to see whether an autopsy yielded any additional or relevant information about conditions that are not directly related to death but might well be of importance to public health. The rate of post-mortem examination, at 9.5% of total hospital deaths, did not show any significant trend over most of the review period. The vast majority of autopsies examined had been requested by the coroner and not by the clinicians. The review showed that an autopsy may be of some value in providing more information regarding any underlying causes of death in elderly psychiatric patients, but has no value in ensuring higher rate of the recording of conditions such as dementia, in particular Alzheimer's disease. Selective hospital autopsy in elderly psychiatric patients to verify, neuropathologically, the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, will improve our diagnostic accuracy and provide valid statistics to be used in estimating prevalence, trends, risk factors and for use in all aspects of future research into Alzheimer's disease.",

        abstract: "Objectives. To examine the methods of fatal self harm (FSH) used by the elderly compared to young adults. Methods. We compared the methods of FSH used by all the elderly over 60 years of age to those used by all younger adults, over 16 and under 60, in the city of Birmingham and Solihull over a period of 4 years, 1995-1998. We applied the term FSH to all deceased who were subjects of Coroner's inquests and attracted verdicts of suicide and open verdicts. Findings. A significantly higher proportion of the elderly who fatally harmed themselves did so by drowning and asphyxia compared to the younger age group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Significantly more women over the age of 60 committed acts of FSH by tying a plastic bag around the neck than those under 60 (p < 0.05). Method of death was not ascertained in a much higher proportion of elderly FSH (p < 0.01). The most common method of suicide among elderly men and women were hanging and self-poisoning by overdose, respectively. Conclusion. The study shows that the most common method of suicide in the elderly is poisoning by drug overdose. It raises the question about the quantity of drugs prescribed for the elderly, e.g. antidepressants, sedatives and pain killers. The study did not confirm previous reports that violent methods are used more frequently with increasing age. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",

The study found no evidence of any statistically significant association between weather parameters and dementia admissions. There was a weak, lagged inverse relationship between dementia admissions and relative humidity and a positive association with diurnal variations in temperature within a week of admission. However, neither finding achieved statistical significance. The study is the first in currently available literature on the subject and may therefore provide a base reference for future studies.

        abstract: "High rates of psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression, alcoholism, drug-use disorder and antisocial personality disorder in the relatives of opiate-dependent patients compared with normal controls, have been reported in some previous studies. This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence rates of drug-use and other psychiatric disorders in the first-degree relatives of opiate-dependent patients and compare these with rates in the first-degree relatives of surgical and psychiatric patients. A case-control study was conducted to compare the prevalence of psychiatric and drug-use disorders (which were estimated by the Family History Method) in 241 biological first-degree relatives of 50 opiate-dependent patients to that in 235 and 222 first-degree relatives of 50 surgical and 50 psychiatric patients respectively. The main outcome measure was the relative risk (expressed as odds ratio) of psychiatric and drug-use disorders. First-degree relatives of opiate-dependent patients were found to have significantly higher rates of drug-use and antisocial personality disorders, compared with relatives of surgical and psychiatric probands. The odds ratio for alcoholism appeared significantly higher only in first-degree female relatives of opiate users, suggesting effect modification by sex. The study provides further evidence for the higher rate of drug-use disorder in the first-degree relatives of opiate-dependent patients. These findings suggest that familial drug-use disorder contributes to a vulnerability to opiate misuse. Implications of these findings for the classification and treatment of opiate dependence are discussed.",

Ninety-four patients (15.3% of total admissions to the unit) spent some time in seclusion on 186 occasions. The average time spent in seclusion was 85 minutes (minimum 15 minutes and maximum 10 hours). Sixty-seven per cent of patients were secluded once, 20% secluded twice, and 13% more than three times. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of personality disorder (11.4%) accounted for 44.2% of seclusions whereas those with a defined mental disorder (55%) accounted for 35% of all seclusions. The rate of seclusion, characteristics of secluded patients, reasons, and average duration spent in seclusion, did not vary significantly over the study period, despite the significant reduction of the unit's admission rate from 150 to 63 per year. The consistent and regular occurrence of the practice over a five-year period may suggest that seclusion of some disturbed patients will inevitably continue to be used as an effective intervention and, probably at times, the only acceptable method that may ensure the safety of patients and staff.",

The review found that time of application of section, length of hospital stay prior to application, medical officer's grade, use of s.5(4) and clinical diagnosis are best predictors of s.5(2) outcome. The results are similar to other published studies and seem to reflect a national pattern, possibly implying that patients detained under this short-term detention order have an almost equal chance of either regaining their voluntary status or being detained under another section by the end of the 72 hours.

The authors found no evidence that the service was abused or that it led to unwarranted admissions. The authors suggest that the service could provide a useful point of entry to mental health services for certain patients. The 'ad hoc' emergency service described here is hoping to become a recognised 'Emergency Clinic' in the reprovided service, after the closure of this 100 yr old psychiatric institution in the very near future.

In this study the term FSH refers to all coroners' verdicts which were recorded in a specified period and included suicide, misadventure and open verdict.METHOD: Five-year data of FSH in North Cheshire was analysed in relation to meteorological data, which were measured at the nearest meteorological office to the study population.RESULTS: Small but significant positive correlations were demonstrated between occurrence of FSH and hours of sunshine (P < 0.01) and diurnal variations in daily temperature (P < 0.05). These effects were independent of gender and psychiatric history.CONCLUSIONS: Weather may influence the occurrence of FSH, probably interacting with biological and social variables. The rate of FSH death appears to be positively related to fine weather conditions, during early summer, and not to extreme weather conditions as previously reported.",

This may be due to a variety of methodological problems including small numbers and variability in the definition of suicide.

In this study, coroner's verdicts of suicide and open verdict which were recorded in a specified period were included.METHOD: Five-year data of deaths resulting from suicide within North Cheshire were analysed in relation to meteorological data, which were measured at the nearest Met office to the study population.RESULTS: Significant positive association was demonstrated between suicide in the elderly and hours of sunshine (p < 0.01) and relative humidity (p < 0.05). These effects were independent of sex.CONCLUSIONS: Weather may influence suicide in the elderly, probably interacting with biological and social variables.

When asked why they enlisted in the treatment program, 30% of those who used crime compared with 14% of those who did not said that they could not afford to fund their habit.
